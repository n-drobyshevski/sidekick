"""Constants for the Databricks pipeline.

Deliberately duplicated rather than imported. ``brick/`` runs on a Spark cluster that has
neither ``wiz_dashboard`` nor Streamlit installed, so it stays self-contained. The sources of
truth these mirror:

* ``wiz_dashboard/config.py``      -- severity taxonomy, SLA targets, resolved statuses
* ``gas/src/domain/insights.ts``   -- EPSS priority threshold
* ``gas/src/domain/program.ts``    -- the risk rule and the capacity dead band

Change one of those and change this too.
